## Application Description 
This is a user-friendly web application that can potentially diagnose breast cancer patients using machine learning classification algorithms. Based on data from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Coimbra), a predictive machine learning model was trained by parameters collected from physical examinations (Age and BMI) and routine blood analysis (Glucose, Insulin, HOMA, Leptin, Adiponectin, Resistin, and MCP-1). I hope that this web application will be helpful for healthcare professionals who work with cancer patients (Caregivers, general practitioners, nurses, and medical oncologists).

## Dataset
### Dataset: Breast Cancer Coimbra Data Set
### About Dataset
Clinical features, including Age, BMI, Glucose, Insulin, HOMA, Leptin, Adiponectin, Resistin and MCP-1, were observed or measured in 64 patients with breast cancer and 52 healthy controls. These clinical features may be used to predict breast cancer.
